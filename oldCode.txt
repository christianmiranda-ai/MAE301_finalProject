            <p>
                This study examines the mechanical performance of various lattice unit cell topologies in stereolithography (SLA) 3D-printed parts. 
                By analyzing stress distribution, deformation behavior, and overall structural efficiency, we aim to optimize lattice structures 
                for engineering applications.

            <h2>Main Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Lattice structures are widely used in aerospace, biomedical, and automotive applications due to their high strength-to-weight ratio.
                Different unit cell designs can significantly influence mechanical performance. We compare the response of different topologies 
                under applied loads, considering factors such as stiffness, failure modes, and manufacturability.
